## This is the README file of the Neural Network algorithm using sklearn

### Prerequisite packages:

numpy
sklearn
scipy
timeit

### Command Line running
In a Python shell import this as a library "import NeuralNet"
The modified MNIST train dataset has to be present as train_x.csv and train_y.csv in the same folder as this code. 
Then run;
Run it on original MNIST(reduced size) 	:	NeuralNet.debugMNIST()
On modified MNIST						:	NeuralNet.main()
